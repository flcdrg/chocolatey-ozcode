    <summary>The revolutionary debugging extension, which complements Visual Studio and supercharges the C# debugging experience.</summary>
    <description>
#### What is OzCode?

OzCode is a Visual Studio Extension which cuts down on debugging time and increases productivity by detecting and isolating bugs, making them easy to fix.

OzCode turns C# debugging into a simple, efficient, and even fun experience!

#### How is the OzCode debugger different from the Visual Studio debugger?

OzCode integrates with the Visual Studio debugger, and expands on its functionality. Among other features, OzCode allows to search for properties, compare objects, evaluate expressions and create trace points - all leading to a fast and productive debugging session.

See http://o.oz-code.com/features for a full description of features
